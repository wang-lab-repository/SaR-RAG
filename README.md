The framework consists of five collaborative components: the Retrieval Decision Gate (RDG), the Hybrid Lexical-Semantic Retriever (HLSR), the Semantic-Aware Chunker (SAC), the Multi-Dimensional Document Scorer (MDDS), and the Context Aggregation Module (CAM).

the RDG model file is located on https://github.com/wang-lab-repository/SaR-RAG/blob/main/src/.model/questions_classifier.py

the Feature Fusion Model model file is located on https://github.com/wang-lab-repository/SaR-RAG/blob/main/src/.model/feature_fusion_model.py

the MDDS model file is located on https://github.com/wang-lab-repository/SaR-RAG/blob/main/src/.model/documents_scorer.py

/src/datasets contains the relevant data from comparison experiments and ablation experiments
